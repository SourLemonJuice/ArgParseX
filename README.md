Comprehensive and configurable command line arguments parser library.\
Written for C language

## Documents

At here(Simplified Chinese): [docs/](./docs/)

## C standard

Compatibility whit C99 is the main thing.\
But i think it might be possible to implement a new interface for C23 with macro switch.\
There has `auto` and `typeof()`... that could make things easier

## Todo

- 时间复杂度可能有点高的说，等最后肯定会去用哈希表什么的啦...
- 重复匹配一个标志的后果？
