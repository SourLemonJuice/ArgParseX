# ArgParseX

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still under development, it doesn't even have a usable API

Comprehensive and configurable command line arguments parser library.\
Written for C language

## Namespace

Those look like `ArgPX_Name`/`argpx_name`/`ArgpxName`/`ARGPX_`/`ARG_PARSE_X_`

Hope it won't be changed
